# DAS-with-RaspberryPi</br>
*GUI development in RaspberryPi for a Data acquisition system.  
This project is to read the data signal,display,control remotely and store it for fututre use.*


## DAS:
 Data Acquisition System is a process of converting data(ADC or DAC),Processing or manipulating data,Storage of data and transmission of data.


## GUI development for RaspberryPi:
### Technologies:
- Python 3.6.8
- tkinter 8.6
- tkcalendar 1.6.1
- DateTime 4.3


### Hardware requirement:
*(Hardware is optional ,local machine with python and it the above mentioned modules are more than enough to test the code)*
- Raspberry pi 
- Display device or VNC viewer


### Files:
* multichannel datalogger menus.pps
    *(protype of UI for reference)*
* DataLogger_windows.py
    *(This is actual python code for Graphical User Interface using simple python modules)*
* Icons
    *(This folder has icons needed to be displayed on the screen)*
    
    
### Installments:
(Installments depends on your machine type)
* Python 3.6.8
   * To install python click **[here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**.
* tkinter       
   * To install tkinter click **[here](https://pypi.org/project/tkintertable/)**.
* tkcalendar
   * To install tkcalendar click **[here](https://pypi.org/project/tkcalendar/)**.
* DateTime

### How to run?
1.Download the *icons* folder.  
2.Keep the images inside the Icons folder and python file in same directory  
  (or) you can replace the directory of the images in the python file.  
3.Run `DataLogger_windows.py` file.  


### Future Development:
Updations will be done in future, as it is in developing stage.    
More windows are to be added to make the user to experience the best interface.
